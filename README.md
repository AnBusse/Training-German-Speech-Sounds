# Training-German-Speech-Sounds
This web project aims to let beginner level learners of German practice their pronunciation of German speech sounds by 3 types of tasks.
In order to practice your pronunciation skills of the German vowels and vowel combinations (so-called diphthongs), you can listen to / watch sound or video files and identify the correct pronunciation of a German word. 
To practice your German consonant pronunciation, you can listen to the pronunciation of a German word and complete the written word below the sound or video file. 
You can practice your German word stress skills by clicking on the stressed syllable of a word. 
If you want to practice some German specialities, like final devoicing, the final "r" or the unstressed "e", there are also categories for that.<br>
You can stop practicing at any time you like while you solve tasks in a Category; your score is saved nevertheless. 
Mainly due to the unreliability of such tools, this page does not offer a speech recognition tool.
Repeating the words as you play the sound or video file will also help you with your pronunciation skills.<br>
All sound or video material display the pronunciation of Standard German, or "Deutsche Hochlautung".
